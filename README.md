# My Personal Portfolio Page

## Description

As my Personal Portfolio Page I tried to create a simple website with visually appealing style where I can showcase my projects and collect all my links where I can be reached. The site is ever evolving and gets updated as I get better at coding and designing.

## Inspired by few of the tutorials found online

### Things I learned:
- How to work with React, React components
- How to use Tailwind CSS to incorporate CSS in HTML using JSX 
- How to personalize the style and design to be responsive
- How to use React Router to setup different paths for different pages

### Challenges during building the project:
- As the website grows I encounter different challenges especially code separations and clean code
- React Components need to be designed to work together well


# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

(https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More
